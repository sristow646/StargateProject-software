Software for Kristian's Fully Functional 3D Printed Stargate

## Setup Instructions:
It is _highly_ recommended to build your gate by using the pre-built Disk Image (ISO) provided by Kristian.
 - If you are **upgrading an existing gate** read this first: [UPGRADING_FROM_V3.X.md](UPGRADING_FROM_V3.X.md)
 - EXPRESS SETUP process can be found in [EXPRESS_SETUP.md](EXPRESS_SETUP.md)
 - A manual setup guide can be found in [ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md)

## Default SSH/SCP credentials
```
Username: pi
Password: sg1
```

## Start/Stop/Restart the Stargate Software manually
The Stargate Software will automatically start when the Raspi boots. It runs as a systemd daemon called `stargate.service`. If you want to manually start/stop/restart it, you can use these commands:
```
sudo systemctl start stargate.service
sudo systemctl stop stargate.service
sudo systemctl restart stargate.service
```

## Web interface
A web interface is provided to allow testing of individual hardware components, dialing, address book, and much more. Find it here:

## Web API
There is a JSON API to interact with the Stargate via a web service. This enables anyone to build software that can control the Stargate. We'd love to see someone build a Stargate Command computer-style controller, or a RPG game that interfaces with the 'Gate. Your imagination is the limit!
